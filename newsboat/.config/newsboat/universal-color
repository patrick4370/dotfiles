# A simple color scheme designed to work well with pretty much any terminal:
#   Uses the basic 16 ANSI colors
#   Works with dark and light (inverted) terminal color schemes
#   Avoids color-on-color text
#   Avoids blue and yellow as those are often too bright or too dim
#   Works with Linux framebuffer terminal despite it being weird with bold text
